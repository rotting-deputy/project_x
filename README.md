project_x is a collection of personal software development projects to showcase my Python journey.
the main.py calls menu(), which in turn calls the handler() for user input.
handler() also calls return_option() whenever user can go back to main menu.
when the user quits, quit_message() is called to provide a fun fact and a goodbye!
All print outs are simulated for aesthetic purposes.
Presently working:
main.py()         # the menu screen, input handler, quit handler
converter.py      # currently only decimal to other types. WIP.
to_do.py          # WIP
Please refer back for future updates!
