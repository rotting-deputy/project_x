# CURRENT BUILD: 0000

project_x is a collection of personal software development projects to showcase my Python journey.

runme.py should be launched first to check you have everything.
If you've downloaded the entire repo, it should be working fine.
If not, please redownload and replace the folder.

Of course, keep any generated files. If replacing repo with existing folder, only python files are replaced.
Therefore, replace per update notices if you want :)

the main.py calls menu(), which in turn calls the handler() for user input.
handler() also calls return_option() whenever user can go back to main menu.
when the user quits, quit_message() is called to provide a fun fact and a goodbye!
All print outs are simulated for aesthetic purposes.

Presently working:

rune.py           # checks dependencies present

main.py           # the menu screen, input handler, quit handler

converter.py      # currently only decimal to other types. WIP.

to_do.py          # WIP

Please refer back for future updates!
